🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of breast cancer using Machine Learning techniques. I have implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify tumors as either 'Malignant' (Cancerous) or 'Benign' (Non-cancerous) based on cell features.
📊 Dataset Details
Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
Objective: To perform Binary Classification for medical diagnosis support.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: * Scikit-Learn: Used for model training and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for data visualization and understanding correlations.
📈 Results
The model analyzes various features (such as radius, texture, and perimeter) to provide a prediction. The current version includes data preprocessing and model evaluation to ensure reliable results
